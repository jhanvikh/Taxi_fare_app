# 🚖 MapMyFare NYC – Taxi Fare Prediction Web App

**MapMyFare NYC** is an interactive web app that predicts taxi fares in New York City based on user-provided trip details such as pickup/dropoff locations, date, time, and passenger count. It also visualizes the route on a live map and shares fun NYC taxi facts!

### 🌐 Live Features

- 📍 Accepts any NYC pickup and dropoff location names (e.g., Times Square, JFK Airport)
- 📆 Select date and time of your ride to get accurate time-based fare estimates
- 👥 Choose number of passengers (1–6)
- 🧠 Predicts fare using a trained **XGBoost** regression model
- 🗺️ Displays trip route on an interactive **Folium** map
- ✨ Shows fun NYC taxi facts on every prediction
